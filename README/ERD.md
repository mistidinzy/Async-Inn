# Async Inn - ERD & Explanations

> To the best of your ability, create a system design of a `database ERD diagram` that meets all of the requirements below.
>
> The diagram should take all of the requirements into consideration and allow a baseline for starting the creation of the web application.

### Build your ERD (Entity Relationship Diagram) so that it has at least:

- (1) Joint Entity Table with Payload
- (1) Pure Join Table
- (1) Enum

### Within your ERD identify/label the following as necessary:

- Primary Keys
- Foreign Keys
- Composite Keys (where they exist)
- Navigation Properties (What other entities are related? Why?)
- Relationships between tables (1:1, 1:Many, Many:1, Many:Many etcâ€¦)

### In a external document, please provide an explanation of the components in your database ERD diagram

> The ERD Design is attempt based. Submit, before the next class start, a healthy attempt on the database design must be completed with all of the required details described.
>
> You may work together and collaborate on this ERD, but everyone is responsible for turning in their own DB diagram and explanation. 2-3 sentences for each table is sufficient for an explanation.
>
> Your ERD diagram must be digital. You may take a picture of your diagram from a white board, but if you decide to stick with your db diagram, and not use the solution provided for your web application, you will be required to transfer your white board image into a cleaner format.
