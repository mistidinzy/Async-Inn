You have been tasked with creating a web based API for a local hotel chain.

Here are the requirements that you obtained from your client during your exploration and requirements meeting:

- The hotel is named “***Async Inn***” and has many nationwide locations.
- Each location will have a name, city, state, address, and phone number.
- Async Inn prides themselves on their unique layout designs of each hotel room.
  - They advertise as it being your “apartment for the night”.
  - This means they have invested a lot of resources into how each room looks and feels.
  - Some have one bedroom, others have 2 bedrooms, while a few are more of a cozy studio.
- The team mentioned that they like to label each room with a **nickname** to better tell the difference between each of the layouts and amenities each room has to offer.
  - For example, the Seattle location has two 2-bedroom suites, but one is named “***Seahawks Snooze***” while the other is named “***Restful Rainier***”, each with their own amenities.
- They also take pride in the amenities that each room has to offer.
  - This can consist of features like “air conditioning”, “coffee maker”, “ocean view”, “mini bar”, the list goes on…
  - They requested that they would like the amenities associated with each of the rooms, as they do vary.
- The rooms vary in price, per location, as well as per room number.
- They also have a few rooms that they want to advertise as pet friendly.
- The number of rooms for each hotel varies. Some hotels have only a few rooms, while others may have dozens.
